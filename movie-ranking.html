<h1>The Best Animes According To May</h1>

<h2>My to 3 animes of all-time</h2>

<h3>Banana Fish</h3>
<p>This is my favorite boy love anime. I really like Arsh and I draw many of his pictures.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>I really like Eren Yeager even though he became villain. And the opening songs and ending songs are really amazing.</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>Super handsome guys are attracting you to watch them. I promise the anime characters will make you feel like human guys are nothing but annoying.</p>
